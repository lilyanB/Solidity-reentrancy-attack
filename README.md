# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

a re-entrancy attack!

Interaction with this contract :

I create this contract : 
https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xd02079C4064fB5fB301124593D0e23B71425d852

And, I run function attack :

To see I am winners, you can run read array name's "winnerds" in contract.
in winners[2570] = 0x607Ec1a7F093801b40DaE21131dDAdB8ce991106
